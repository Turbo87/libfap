Installation
------------

To install libfap on UNIX-like system use the normal procedure:

./configure [--prefix=/opt or other options]
make
<become root if necessary>
make install

For detailed installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

Usage
-----

Usage info is available at http://pakettiradio.net/libfap/docs/ . A local
copy of the docs can be generated by running doxygen with the attached
Doxyfile. When in doubt, see the fap.h header file directly.

Differences
-----------

There is one intentional difference between the original Perl module and
libfap. The Bob has apparently said that a space or a / can be placed in the
beginning of station commment in order to separate it clearly from APRS
data. FAP.pm removes these characters and also other whitespaces from
beginning and end of the comment. Libfap does not remove these, as I believe
that making things look nice is a job for user of the parser, not the parser
itself. This way you can also use the original comment as-is, if you want
to.
